# javaEncryptor
The main objective of the project JAVA ENCRYPTOR is to easily use the desktop application for encrypting and decrypting the entered string using the specified key and algorithm.
  
Certain messages and text require proper encryption so that the text can be sent privately and can be decrypted only using the same key.

This desktop app made in JAVA using SWING lets you add Application name and its key in a text file separated by space. After that the app is started and lets you choose the application name for the key and the algorithm by which you want to encrypt your message. Then you are supposed to enter the string to be encrypted. After clicking the encrypt button, the encrypted value will be shown in Response Text Field. Similarly you can decrypt the encrypted string.
